# Statistical Modelling In SAS

This repo contains some selected problem sets, homeworks, labs, exams, etc that illustrate various types of statistical analysis in SAS.  Starting from simple linear regression, moving on to multiple linear regression, and finally logistic regression.

There will be either 2 or 3 files per problem set which will include: the problem set itself, my solutions/write-up to the problem set, and the SAS code that I used to generate those solutions.

There are a few instances where I used both SAS and R to complete a problem set - in those instances both the SAS & R files will be included.


   Lab 1: Simple Linear Regression
   Lab 2: Multiple Linear Regression Part 1
   Lab 3: Multiple Linear Regression Part 2
